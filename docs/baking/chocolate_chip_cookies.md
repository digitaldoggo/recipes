## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, brewer's yeast, flaxseed, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
3. In the bowl of your electric mixer, beat the butter and coconut oil on medium speed until creamy.
4. Add the sugar to the butter mixture and beat on medium to high speed until fluffy, about 4 to 5 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
5. Add the egg and egg yolk to the mixture, beating until combined, about 2 to 3 minutes.
6. Add the vanilla extract and beat until combined again.
7. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, beating on low speed until just combined.
8. Stir in the chocolate chips (and any optional add-ins) with a spatula until evenly dispersed.
9. Scoop the dough into 1-inch rounds (use an ice cream scoop for uniform size) and place them on a baking sheet about 2 inches apart.
10. Bake for 10 to 14 minutes, or until the bottoms are just golden.
11. Let the cookies cool completely before storing them in a sealed container.

> ## Notes
>
> - **Freezing Dough**: Scoop the dough rounds onto a baking sheet, freeze for 2 hours, then transfer to a ziplock bag. Bake directly from frozen at the same temperature, adding 1-2 extra minutes if needed.
> - **Butter and Coconut Oil**: You can use all butter if coconut oil is unavailable. Substituting more coconut oil for butter will cause the cookies to spread more. Reducing the total fat will result in drier cookies.
> - **Whole Wheat Flour**: You can substitute 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour with similar results. Using more may make the cookies drier and grittier.
> - **Sugar Reduction**: You can reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup without affecting the recipe.
> - **Vegan or Gluten-Free Variations**: This recipe has not been tested with vegan substitutes or gluten-free flour.
> - **Brewer's Yeast**: You can increase the brewer's yeast by 1 to 2 tablespoons if desired.
