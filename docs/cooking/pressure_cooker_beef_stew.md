## Directions

1. **Season the Beef** – In a medium-sized bowl, combine cubed beef, ½ teaspoon salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon soy sauce.
2. **Heat Instant Pot** – Select "Saute" on the Instant Pot. Allow the device to heat up. It will indicate "Hot" on the display when ready.
3. **Sear the Meat** – Add 2 tablespoons olive oil. Once hot, add the beef and brown on one side for 2 minutes, flip and brown for another 2 minutes. Transfer to a clean plate, the meat will not be fully cooked.
4. **Saute the Aromatics** – Add 1 tablespoon oil and onions, and saute for 1 minute. Add garlic and saute for 30 seconds. Add balsamic vinegar to deglaze the bottom of the pot for 3 minutes, stir and scrape to remove any browned bits.
5. **Add the Ingredients** – Add the potatoes, carrots, celery, browned beef, beef stock, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and ½ teaspoon salt, and stir to combine.
6. **Cover the Instant Pot** – Press "Keep/ Warm/Cancel" on the Instant Pot. Make sure that the release valve is in the "Sealing" position. Place the lid on, turn and lock.
7. **Pressure Cook** – Press the "Manual" button on the Instant Pot on high pressure, and then set the timer to 20 minutes using the "+" or "-" buttons. The pot will take about 15 minutes to heat up and build pressure. You will see some steam release from the lid, and then the time will start on the display.
8. **Release the Pressure** – Once cook time is complete, allow the pressure to naturally release for 15 minutes.
9. **Open Lid** – Use an oven mitt or towel to slowly and carefully twist the steam release handle on the lid to the "Venting" position. The initial release will spray some moisture around the pot, so be careful. Remove the lid, opening the top away from you as steam will be released.
10. **Thicken the Stew** – In a small bowl, combine cornstarch and water to make a slurry. Select "Saute" on the Instant Pot. Once the stewing liquid begins to boil, add the cornstarch slurry. Cook and stir for 60 to 90 seconds, and turn off the heat once thickened. Add the peas and cook, for 2 to 4 minutes.
11. **To Serve** – Garnish with cilantro and serve hot with rice or mashed potatoes.
